## Stakeholders
### Nicholas Wong, Data Science Student
"I've always been interested in origami, but I don't know where to start. The paper is different and there are some intricate techniques. I want start with some easier ones before diving into something with hundreds of steps." 

### Goals/Needs
* Enable users to learn how to make any given origami
* Assign any given origami to a specific difficulty
* Offer detailed information about necessary resources for each origami
* Sell origami goods to facilitate making origami
* Integrate interactive step-by-step tutorials with animations, images or videos. 
* Provide a community space where users can post, share, and receive feedback or assistance. 
* Offer project recommendations based on user preferences, skill level, or past projects 


### Problems/Frustrations
* Uncertainy towards quantifiable difficulty of origami
* Difficulty in choosing what to create
* Limited access to origami paper
* Struggles with properly learning origami techniques
* Lack of access to personalized guidance or tutorials for complex origami designs. 
* Inconsistent opportunity to get feedback from peers in discussion posts (heavily based on community effort unless there are paid experts).
